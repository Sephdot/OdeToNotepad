## What do I want to say??

- My IDE of choice for this tiny static website is Windows Notepad.
- I decided that VSCode, Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider, and even Notepad++ came with so many nice features that I'd get distracted learning all the cool features and rely on the IDE to bridge gaps in my knowledge
- For a group project or a large one, I think that the benefits of a proper code editor or IDE outweigh the negatives, but Intellisense and autocompletion is making me stupid. I want to struggle and be forced to look things up; I want the pain of syntax errors.
- I want to use the CLI and keyboard shortcuts actively since I believe that despite the initial difficulty of learning text-based tools, the payoff is worth it.
- wanted to make a really nice clean website, taking time to poke around the internet and steal some cool things i like, mostly from CSS blogs!
