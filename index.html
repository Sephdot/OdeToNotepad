<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>As a total beginner to coding, I've been overwhelmed with the abundance of free, high-quality and efficient tools at my fingertips. IDEs like Visual Studio and JetBrains Rider; code editors like VS Code and Notepad++.</p>
<p>At first, everything was great! I loved zooming around and peeking at C# source code with Jump to Definition (F12) in Visual Studio, the trove of cool plugins in VS Code, and the Language selection feature in Notepad++ when I was writing razor components to switch between C# and HTML... Not to mention Intellisense!</p>
<p>One day, however, I decided to challenge myself to write a program or a little bundle of methods solely in Notepad, and soon found out that I had no absolutely idea what I was doing.</p>
<p>I was staring at a blank screen with only a blinking caret to keep me company: no tab to complete; no user-friendly GUIs; no live syntax error catching. I realised that even in the (very) short amount of time I'd spent learning to code, I'd become reliant on fancy tools to make really basic things.</p>
<p>That day made me feel quite stupid, so I decided to make this cute webpage to document my struggles!</p>
